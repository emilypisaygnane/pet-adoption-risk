Risk Assessment 

Risk: Not being able to use the PetFinder API, I found more API's I can pull from, using a scraper (maybe)
https://www.petfinder.com/developers/
https://www.programmableweb.com/news/top-10-pets-apis/brief/2020/05/10

Mitigation: The prototype would probably combine at least three past projects I have done already, such as the Book Shoppe app, an app that I called an API, and one of the pet apps I've made.

Timebox: 3 Hours

Failure Plan: If I can't get my protype up and running in the timebox, I will pull in TAs and/or the instructor to help guide and point out where I could have paid more attention to and less attention to. I believe I can get it done since I have some example code to help.
